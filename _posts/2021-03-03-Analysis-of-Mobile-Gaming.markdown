# Analysis of Mobile Gaming Market — A Story of Litigations and Trends!



Global mobile games revenue is expected to reach \$102.8 billion in 2023, up from $77.2 billion in 2020, with Asia being the top region in the mobile gaming industry.¹ Over the past 10 years the industry has moved away from being a hit-driven business and towards having a few established players that have “live-operations” — which involves constantly adding new features.

For example, between August 2019 to January 2021, PUBG, Honor of Kings, and Roblox consistently remained within the top ten grossing games. A majority of the top ten is made up Chinese publishers, with Tencent leading the pact, despite Japanese publishers such as Konami and Sony making gains.² In fact, January 2021 saw Tencent’s Honor of Kings gross $267.3 million, 97% of which was from China.³ The geographic landscape of gaming is unlikely to change , with major players continuing to be based in China.

The geographic landscape may be stable, but the regulatory landscape is seeing tectonic shifts. Epic Games, Inc. v. Apple Inc. is a current lawsuit which challenges “anti-competitive actions that Apple undertakes to unlawfully maintain its monopoly in two distinct, multibillion dollar markets: (i) the iOS App Distribution Market, and (ii) the iOS In-App Payment Processing Market.” ⁴ Currently both Apple and Google charge a 30% commission for hosting apps on their platform.⁵ This resulted in the formation of Coalition for App Fairness, who are advocating “for freedom of choice and fair competition across the app ecosystem”.⁶

Seperatley in October 2020, The Judiciary House report, part of the FTC antitrust investigations into Big Tech, accused the Apple (along with Google) of exerting “monopoly power” in mobile app store market, leaving developers with little choice for reaching consumers.⁷ The ruling will likely tighten regulations on both Google and Apple forcing both to reduce commissions. In response Apple introduced the “App Store Small Business Program” which reduces commission to 15% for small businesses earning up to $1 million per year; further reducing barrier to entry for seed-round start-ups.⁸ This provides precedent for Epic Games to win its own lawsuit, which may mean that mobile game publishers will be able to provide in-game payments processing — increasing margins for microtransaction.

Unlikely traditional consoles, the mobile gaming industry centres around “cost-per-install” and “life-time-value” and have have a large installed base. This has meant revenues have surged during the pandemic, as consumers turn to digital distractions.⁹

Between March and April 2020, the price of Facebook and Twitter ads dropped 16% and 19% respectively.¹⁰ The industry capitalised on the lower advertising costs and saw compounded returns thanks more efficient marketing and organic usage growth. A tactic favoured by Playtrix, which saw downloads double to 100 million.¹¹

In fact, Unity’s June 2020 global report found that since start of the pandemic microtransactions had grown by 24%, with mobile gaming ad impressions and ad revenue surging by 54% and 59% respectively, whilst simultaneously cost per install fell by 33%. Pandemic gamers were also noticed to exhibit different behaviour — converting to paying users 27.5% more often, despite generating 8% less daily revenue.¹² Though companies such as Supercell have seen profits slip as they failed to capitalise on this boom.¹³

Another success of the pandemic is Zynga which specialises in hyper casual gaming. Usually free-to-play though can be highly lucrative through advertisements, they are games cheaply and rapidly produced to capitalise on the moment. Thanks to its virality on TikTok, Zynga had the most downloaded iPhone app in the U.S during February 2021.¹⁴

As the hyper-casual gaming market continues to mature, Zynga have been making multiple acquisitions, most recently Peak Games for \$1.8 billion.¹⁵ With its ad business growing by 47% last quarter to ​\$117m in revenue. Although gaming only makes up a third of App Stores downloads, it accounts for 70% of consumer spending, in the year ahead Zynga expects total revenues to climb 32% to $2.6bn, and forecasts double-digit gains in 2022.¹⁶

Though the space is still nascent, competition is already fierce, with competitors such as Hero Games, Voodoo (which recently saw its valuation rise $1.4 billion) and Rollic Games (acquired by Zynga). This has led to litigations between the three as the sector grows.¹⁷

Another area largely untapped is AR gaming, despite AWS, Unreal and Unity reducing the barrier to entry, hardware limitations had made games clunky. This may be soon be overcome with the introduction of the LiDAR scanner to the iPhone 12 Pro alongside the new development platform (ARKit 4).¹⁸ Despite reassessment due to COVID, the AR mobile gaming market is expected to reach $21.7 Billion by 2027 (with a CAGR of 41.9%).¹⁹

An early entry into the AR gaming word is Niantic, creators of Pokémon Go, who as of January 2019 closed a Series C round at a \$4 billion valuation.²⁰ Despite game experiencing a brief drop early in the pandemic, the number of monthly active users rose by 45% between January and August 2020, ²¹ generating an annual revenue of $1.92 billion in 2020 (the highest in its history).²² Suggesting an optimistic long term future AR gaming and a likely post-pandemic boom.

Finally, changing demographics means changing preferences. With millennial showing a preference towards console and nostalgia games, Gen-Z have a preference for mobile games and ad-revenue models. Currently 90% of Gen-Z engage in gaming.²³ As their purchasing power increases, we expect growth within the hyper-casual gaming market and an industry shift towards ad-based revenue models, with valuation reaching $94 billion by 2024.²⁴ We see early shifts towards an ad-based future as Unity (which saw its share surged during its IPO debut by 48%)²⁵ has partnered with Snap Inc. to extend the abilities of ad-tech, further engaging and targeting Gen-Z gamers.²⁶

Another underserved market that could see rapid growth are women, who have shown a preference for puzzle games, making up 76% of consumers. Currently 60% of women game, though feel they are underserved, despite 48% playing more than 5 times a week and 4.5% spending in-game; in comparison to men’s 38% and 3.3%.²⁷ Playtrix could see further growth once it taps into the female gamer demographic.

Overall, the gaming industry is particularly healthy, despite the pandemic and we expect further growth to follow. Investors should consider publishers that focus either on ad-based revenue models, targeting female gamers (over the short term) or AR game (over the medium term).
