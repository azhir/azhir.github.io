**Technical Skills:** *Proficient in MATLAB and Excel. Experienced in R, C/ C++, Python, CAD, EMACS, VIM, QGIS*

------

**Profile** My resilience and determination has pushed me to take some of the most challenging courses my university has to offer, which have strengthened my analytic and problem-solving abilities. During my summers, I took on various programming/analysis roles, and in my final year demonstrated ‘excellence’ in my computational project. I have collaborated with various teams and have applied my research skills to write proposals. I am interested in emerging markets, IPOs and disruptive innovation.

------

**Final Year** Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics, General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Physics, Stellar Structure and Evolution, Cosmology, Stellar Dynamics and Galaxy Formation, Observational Astrophysics, Computational Projects.

### **Final Year Projects**

**Gravitational Radiation from Point Masses in Keplerian Orbits**

- Used *MATLAB* to numerically integrate coupled differential equations with varying initial conditions and thus model the magnitude of gravitational waves produced by neutron star mergers.
- Investigated the feasibility of the migration hypothesis for the existence of hot Jupiters.

**Particle or Photon Orbits near a Black Hole**

- Used *MATLAB* to analyse the Schwarzschild solution and thus model the path taken by particles as they approach a black hole.
- Investigated the properties of gravitational lensing and photon scattering.
