**Who Am I?** <br/>
An age old questions many weary travellers have asked themselves. Am I a person? Am I a wiggly arrangement of benzene rings and protein molecules masquerading as a self-conscious life form? Am I just a projection of information encoded around the edge of the observable universe? Anyways none of these questions are particularly relevant and for the sake of simplicity let us just start by agree that physics has no axioms and separately I am a recent Natural Sciences/Astrophysics graduate from the University of Cambridge.

**What is this page for?** <br>
This website is essentially a way of me introducing myself and ideas I find exciting and interesting to the world. (It also works as a way for employers to hopefully find me).

------

**Is this a serious website?** <br/>
Not at all, it's a way of me experimenting and updating the world on various projects I am working on.

**Did you type this all without giving it much thought?** <br/>
Yes. I recently came across the idea of the minimum viable product. Just get started with stuff and don't put it off. So this is me not putting stuff off and doing stuff with my life.
